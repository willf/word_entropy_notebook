# word_entropy_notebook
A Python Notebook exploring word entropy

To run this notebook 'as is', you'll need to place the file `1gram.tsv` in the 
same directory as the notebook. Each line should be a tab-separated file with 
two columns (no header): a word token, and a count.

The notebook as is uses only tokens with just letters in them, and just the first 10^6 of those.
